            <li>Remove saucepan from heat, squeeze excess water from gelatine sheets and stir them into the passion fruit puree. Set it aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Assemble</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Since both coconut part and the passion fruit part contains gelatine, 
                you have to be careful not letting them fully set before fully assembling in the mold, 
                so don&apos;t let them fully cool. Stir them occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grab your Silikomart Color mold and let&apos;s start the assembling process. Pipe the white part (coconut panna cotta) into the middle of each cavity, then pipe some more coconut panna cotta into the outer circle
            </li>
            <li>
                Place mold in to the freezer for 15 min so that the coconut part can set before proceeding to the next step. 
                Leave the rest of the coconut cream at room temp and stir it occasionally so it won&apos;t set.
            </li>
            <li>Once coconut part fully sets in the freezer, proceed with piping the passion fruit part on top.</li>
            <li>
                Freeze the mold again now for 30 minutes. 
                Make sure you occasionally stir the remaining coconut part so it won&apos;t set while mold is in the freezer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once passion fruit part fully sets in freezer, proceed with piping the remaining white (coconut) part on top. 
                Let it chill in the freezer for min 6h, overnight is even better.
            </li>
            <li>
                After panna cottas are fully frozen, gently but firmly release them from the mold. 
                Make sure you press the middle particularly so it won&apos;t stuck into the mold
            </li>
            <li>Place each panna cotta onto the coconut sable cookie while panna cotta is frozen.</li>
            <li>Let the panna cotta thaw either at room temp or in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Store refridgarated for 2-3 days</li>
        </ol>
