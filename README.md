This is the first assignment in the Foundations path of The Odin Project.

This project will highlight all the skills acquired in the HTML foundations.

On this page, you will find:

1) The standard HTML boilerplate;
2) The use of Elements and Tags;
3) The use of Lists;

There will also be commit messages based on what we learned in the homonymous lesson.
